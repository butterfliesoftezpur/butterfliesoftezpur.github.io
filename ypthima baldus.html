   		<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Field Characters</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b>The underside is pale, whitish or faint brown, with brown streaks. On the fore wing is a large eye-spot enclosed in a golden-yellow ring. A 'U'-shaped dark marking encloses this eye-spot. These markings are present in both the wet and dry season forms. On the underside of the hind wing 6 eye-spots, in three pairs, are present. These eye-spots, in the dry season form, are represented by dots. A large eye spot on the upperside of each fore wing is distinct when the butterfly is basking. The male and female are similar in appearance.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Status, Distribution and Habitat</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> It is very common in dry and moist deciduous forests and on forest paths or other openings in semi- evergreen and evergreen forests. It avoids dense vegetation in all habitats and is more plentiful in secondary forests. It also occurs in shrublands, but not as commonly as in the forests. It is active throughout the year, although in drier areas it may be rare in the summer and restricted to nullahs and valleys. Otherwise in the monsoon the wet season form and in the winter and summer the dry season form are very common. It is distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent, except in Sri Lanka, and to the cast all the way to Japan and south to southeast Asia.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Habits</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> In the morning the Five-ring baskswith its wings spread out halfway, revealingthe large eye-spots on the fore wings. Once itis warm enough to become active, it moves about in short bursts of a dancing, ‘hopping’ style of flight. It is a modest flier and does not go far without halting a few times en route, always keeping close to the ground. Individuals from central Western Ghats, while sitting on the grass or fallen leaves, sometimes draw the fore wings between the hind wings to hide the yellow ringed eye-spot on the fore wing, which is the only moment this dull butterfly wears. It visits wet soil, especially in the summer or on hot days in other seasons. It is also a frequent visitor to flowers, unlike most of other Browns. Small herbs and shrubs, especially favourites such as Adelocaryum, Cipadessa fruticosa, Tridax, Clerodendron serratum, when flowering, are crowded with dozens of individuals. It spends a long time on the flowers, probing deep in each flower and occasionally flashes the eye-spots on the fore wings with rather prolonged flick of the wings.</b></font></h1>
