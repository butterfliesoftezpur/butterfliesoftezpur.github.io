	Male: Upperside black; fore wing with an obliquely placed white maculated spot in areas 3-5 at or beyond of cell, this spot margined with bright bluish, two preapical elongate white spots, an inwardly curved postdiscal series of minute white dots ending anteriorly below the preapical white patches. Hind wing with a large medial bright bluish spot broadly centred with white, a postdiscal series of white minute white dots as in continuation with that on fore wing, marginal faint white lunules becoming obsolete anteriorly. Underside deep purplish brown; fore wing with some minute white flecks onbelow basal half of costal margin, an oblique discal series of three very slender streaks and elongate spots from costa to area 3, preapicaI spots and psotdiscal series of white dots as onupperside, a submarginal series of double cone-shaped spots between veins and marginal row of white lunules, both the submarginal and marginal series becoming obsolete anteriorly above vein 5. Hind wing with a discal series of white bluish maculated band from costa to inner margin, a postdiscaI series of minute white dots as in continuation with that on fore wing, a submarginal series of double cone-shaped spots between veins, followed by an inner marginal series of white and outer dark brown Iunules.
Female: Upperside dark brown; fore Wing pale towards outer margin, a few small bluish subcostal spots above the cell, a postdiscal sinuous series of white spots placed between the veins,followed by a submarginalseries of short transverse white narrow markings and a marginal series of white lunules, both these submarginal and marginal series becoming obsolete anteriorly beyond vein 5. Hind wing with basal half dark brown and distal half paler; a postdiscaI series of white spots in areas 2-6, a submarginal series of double cone-shaped white spots between the veins followed by a marginal series of white lunules. Underside dull brown; fore wing with apical half paler, a few minute white bluish flecks on and one or two small white spots just below the basal half of costal margin, a postdiscal series of white spots and the spot being largest in area 1 but spots reduced to dots or obsolete above vein 3, submarginal double cone shaped whitespots and marginal lunules obsolete above vein 5. Hind wing with basal half brown but distal half paler, a postdiscal series of faint white spots in areas 2-6, followed by a submarginal series of double coneshaped white spots and a marginal series of white lunules but spots and lunules of these series being faint.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Variation</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> Both sexes vary much in appearance. In male, upperside of hind wing with bright bluish white spot may be without pale centering. In female, upperside of fore wing with the discal oblique shining blue spots may be reduced to one spot. The underside of both the seasonal forms is also variable as to the presence or absence of the discal white band and submarginal white markings on the hind wing; the latter white markings may be much reduced in size.</b></font></h1>

Habits: The butterfly has a powerful and graceful flight. The male has a striking appearance with opening and closing wings in the sunshine on a prominent leaf or twig, often high up on a tree. It is a very pugnacius chasing away any butterfly approaching it. It prefers the same perch upon which it is found day after day. The female flies more slowly than the male and keeping close to the ground among bushes, in forest or in gardens, and low-growing species of Urticaceae. It rests on the underside of leaves with its wings closed over the back. It may enter into residential areas to settle in dark comers. It mimicks the Indian crow Euploeacore (Cramer) of Danainae. It is amigratory butterfly.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Habitat and ecology</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> It occurs in mainly open and lightly forested country. It is generally abundant in the wetter and forested parts of especially during the rains and it is not so common elsewhere but widely distributed and found almost throughout the plains. It ascends 1550m in the hills with occasional stragglers at about 2150m. </b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Life history</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> The larva is cylindrical and armed with nine longitudinal rows of fine branched spines. Its colour is very dark rich brown but head is light brown. The larva is occasionally found in the verandahs of dwellings. The pupa is dark earthy brown and mottled with a lighter shade. The pupal stage lasts for 10-12days or even up to 20 days.</b></font></h1>
