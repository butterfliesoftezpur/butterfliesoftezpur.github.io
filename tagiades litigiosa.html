<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Field Characters</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b>The Water Snow Flat is unlike any other butterfly in the Indian peninsula. It is dark brown with a few semi-transparent spots onthe fore wing. but the most distinctive characteristic is the outer two-thirds of the upperside of the hind wings, which are snow white. A series of large black spots are present at the edge of hind wing, contrasting with the white patch. The male and female are similar.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Status, Distribution and Habitat</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b>The Water Snow Flat is common in evergreen, semi-evergreen and relatively undisturbed. extensive, moist deciduous forests. It is more common along paths and other openings in the evergreen forest where deep shade is available, but also in some sunny patches. It is found in suitable forested areas in Sri Lanka, the Western Ghats and central India and from the lower Himalayas east of Shimla to northeast India, southern China, extending south to whole of Southeast Asia.
This butterfly may be found throughout the year. In evergreen and semi-evergreen forests it may be common all year round, but in the deciduous forests may be confined to the wet season and to riparian forests. In any case, it is particularly plentiful in the post monsoon months.</b></font></h1>

<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Habit</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b>The first encounter with the Water Snow Flat is often the sight of a dazzling little snowy-white fleck dancing rapidly and erratically in the shade and light of the forest path. Since the fire wings are dark, they arerarely fully visible while the butterfly is flying in the dappled light of the forest, thus only the bright white hind wings are easily visible. The flight is fast and smooth, but with intermittent jerks, sometimes like hovering. While active, it settles on the uppersides of the leaves, usually near the tips or the edges of leaves, 3-4 m off the ground, thus overlooking the world of undergrowth and small trees from its perch. From this vantage point it carries out dutifully its policing, chasing any other objects that may be flying by. These quarrelsome activities are taken up when it is warming up or after it has fed. For basking, it sits on either the upper side or the undersides of leaves in sunny or shady patches and spreads its wings flat to the leaf. It raises the front legs so that the thorax is also slightly raised. For resting, however, it goes to the underside of a leaf, applies its body close to the leaf and usually chooses shade plants upon which to do so. It is wary and takes to the wing at the slightest disturbance. It is territorial, therefore it flutters around for only short while and may return to rest under the same leaf, if permitted.
It feeds on flowers and apparently acanthaceous ones, such as various species of Strobilanthes, Crossandra, Peristrophe, etc. are preferred. It visits bird droppings lying on the leaves with equal enthusiasm and occasionally visits wet soil.</b></font></h1>
