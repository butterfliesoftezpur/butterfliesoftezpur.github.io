Male: Upperside rich orange yellow; fore wing with a pair of black lines enclosing a short bar of ground colour across the cell, a black bar at end of cell but with ground colour being obsolete, another black bar beyond end of cell; the costal margin dusky black, the inner and outer submarginal lines and a marginal line being dusky black and closely placed; a discal large and minutely white centred ocellus with an inner and outer black ring in area 2, two similar smaller geminate subapical black ocelli joining with the black costal margin by a short black bar; wing produced apically and falcate. Hind wing with a smaller discal pale light tawny and white centred ocellus in area 2, a larger ocellus extending from vein 4 to above vein 7, the ocellus consisting of an outer black and inner yellow ring, the latter inwardly with a brown area bearing two white spots and outwardly with a bluish black area; the inner and outer submarginal lines and the marginal line as on fore wing but being wavy and well spaced, wing produced into a tail at tomus Underside of wings ochraceous brown; and crossed bybasal and discal pale sinuous lines, the discal line margined outwardly by a blackish shade, the latter bearing ,a row of obscure black spots and followed by a submarginal sinuos line. Fore wing with three short blackish sinuous bands in the cell including outer one at the end of cell, the basal and discal pale lines being sinuous, the discal line margined outwardly by a blackish shade, the latter bearing a row of obscure black spots and followed by a submarginal sinuous line. Hind wing with the basal and discal line and other markings as on fore wing but the discal line meeting the submarginal line posteriorly near the tornus.Female:like that of male but larger and paler. 
WSF: Male: Upperside like that of DSF, but the black margins deeper and heavier, the submarginal and marginal lines weIl defined. Underside of wings pale ochraceous. Fore with seven short sinuous blackish lines of which, five in the cell, one at end of cell and another beyond the cell, the latter two lines angulated inwardly at vein 4 and continued to the inner margin and the space between them forming a fascia, posteriorly this fascia becoming paler to whitish; the postdiscal ocelli, submarginal and marginal lines as on upperside but paler. Hind wing with a slender subbasal blackish line, a discal whitish fascia in, continuation from the fore wing, the postdiscal ocelli, submarginal and marginal lines as on upperside but paler, the ocellus extending from vein 4 to 7 with a double pupil and centre. Female: almost like that of male but larger and paler.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Variation</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> This species shows the seasonal forms of very different shapes as well as markings on underside. 
There are two subspecies found in India. 
i)	J. almana almana (Linnaeus)- (60-65mm). Upperside rich fulvous; hind wing with ocellus very large extending from vein 4 to vein 7. Underside of DSF leaf like and wings much produced. Underside of WSF ocellated and wings rounded. Andamans, widely distributed in India. Myanmar, Sri Lanka.
ii)	 J. almana nicobariensis (Felder)- It differs from the nominate subspecies mainly by the lesser wing expanse. 
Wing expanse: Male, female 50-65 mm. 
Habits: It inhabits gardens and is fond of flowers. The underside of dry season form is protective as it remarkabley resembles a dry leaf. It settles among rubbish or dead leaves with wings closed and bent over to one side displaying protective markings on wings. It presents a classical example of the most highly-developed seasonal dimorphism. It destroys the rice fields on a large scale (Varshney, 1978).</b></font></h1> 
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Habitat and ecology</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b>It flies to elevations of about 2300m in the hills but very common at low elevations of below 1200m, especially in moist places and at the foot of Ghats. 
Life history: The larva is cylindrical. Its head is blackish and slightly hairy and body being pale ochreous-brown. The second to last segments are armed with a dorsal, subdorsal, and two lateral rows of short, fine-branched spines. The pupa is brownish-ochraceous It is short and thick with head and thorax broad: Its thorax and abdomen bear short tubercular points dorsally.</b></font></h1>
