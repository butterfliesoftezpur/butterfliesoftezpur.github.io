<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Morphological characters</i></u></b></font></h1></li>
 <h1><font color="white"><b>Male: Upperside of wings black withmarkings white. Fore wing with white cell streak divided into a basal streak and a triangular spot beyond being broad and outwardly sharp, a sinuous discal series of spots but spot absent in area 4, the costal streak in discal band very short, a postdiscal series of whit spots followed by a submarginal series of indistinct white spots, the latter obsolete anteriorly towards costa. Hind wing with a curved subbasal band, usually of even width, the discal and submarginal lines paler, the postdiscal series of well separated quadrate spots of which the anterior and posterior most being smallest. Underside of wings pale golden ochraceous to dark ochraceous or almost chocolate; white markings as on upperside but broader and defined in black. Fore wing with areas 1b and 2 from base to apex shaded with black, the postdiscal series of small spots on its either side with narrow white markings. Hind wing with a basa white streak on costal margin, a more slender white streak below the forme streak, the discal and submarginal pale lines of upperside replaced bynarrow white lines with more narrower black margins. Female- almost like that of male but larger and paler. 
WSF: It differs from DSF in the more narrow white markings and in the slightly , darker ground colour and broader black margins to the spots and bands on the underside. 
Variation: The species varies much in the ground colouration, size and number of white spots, bands and streaks on the wings. 
The following five species occur in India.
i)	N. hylas varmona Moore- Upperside of wings with white markings broad and sharp. Underside of wings rather dark ochreous and fore wing beyond cell with veins prominently black. Peninsular India (North Kanara, Coorg, Nilgiris, Madras Presidency). Sri Lanka. Very common.
ii)	N. hylaskamarupa Moore- Upperside of wings with markings broad. Underside of wings bright golden ochreous and veins not blackened. Assam, Sikkim, West Bengal. Very common. 
iii)	N. hylas andamana Moore - Like that of kamrupa; upperside of hind wing with postdiscal banq narrow and underside of hind wing with inner discal band more prominently black edged. Andaman & Nicobar Islands (Andaman Islands, Great Coco Island). Common. 
iv)	N. hylas nicobarica Moore- Upperside of fore wing spots in areas 2 and 3 directed to apex. All markings very broad. Underside ochreous and white markings along margin broader, hind wing with inner discal band constricted at ends. Car and Central Nicobars or Northern and Central Nicobars. Common. 
v)	N. hylas sambalinga Evans- Upperside of wings with markings reduced, but submarginal spots distinct, the hind wing with central (discal) band narrower. Underside darker, hind wing with the black edging to central (discal) band broader. South Nicobars (Little Nicobar and Pulo Condul). Common. </b></font></h1>

<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Habits</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> The flight of this species is typical of the genus, with a few flicks of the wings it sails gracefully along with the wings held horizontal. In the hot and dry weather, it rests on wet patches or damp stones to suck up moistures. At rest or in hides, it keeps its wings closed over the back in the usual manner. 
Habitat and ecology: It is very common in woods, gardens, damp places and forested nullahs in the hills. It is found everywhere except in the most arid regions of the north-west and north. It flies throughout the year and ascends to 2700m. </b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Life history</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> The butterfly lays the egg on the upperside of a leaf and usually at the point. The larva on emerging eats the egg-shell and then moves to make a bed for itself upon the extreme point of midrib. It gnaws a lot of pieces of the leaf and hangs them by silken threads from its perch. As the larva grows it lengthens the portion ofthe midrib by eating off the more surface of the leaf. After the third moult, it generally gnaws the stem of the leaf so that it hangs down and withers, curling in the process. The larva sits in the curl and wanders away to feed. The larvae vary in colour so as to match the different shades of withered leaves. The larva is sluggish, walking haltingly and resting with the head turned round on the side and with the face bowed. The pupation takes place on the underside of a leaf or twig and the attachment is firm and strong. Thus, the pupa hangs rigidly and it wriggles when touched.</b></font></h1>
