Field Characters: This is a predominantly white butterfly. The apex of fore wing on the upper side is black with a few terminal black spots. The hind wings have black marginal spots. A large black spot present in the outer half of the fore wings is visible on both wing surfaces. The underside of the hind wings is dirty white, densely dusted with dirty yellow, grey and greenish scales. Its dry season forms are more heavily dusted with such scales. The female has an additional black spot on the upper side of the fore wings.
Status, Distribution and Habitat: The southern Indian population of this species is restricted to the shola forests, grasslands and agricultural fields at heights of above 1, 500 m, in the Nilgiris, Anamalais, Palnis, Meghamalais and other hilly regions. However, it has been recorded a couple of times from Bangalore. This butterfly is very common at the edges of sholas, on roads and in large clearingsinthe forests and around tea estates. As its larval host plants include cabbages and the kin of family Brassicaceae (= Cruciferae), it also inhabits cultivated fields in these areas. It is active throughout the year, but more common from the late monsoon months through summer. Apart from southern India, it occurs northwards and eastwards from the Himalayas up to Japan, inhabiting areas with subtropical and temperate climate.</b></font></h1>
<li><h1><font color="white"><b><u><i>Habits</i></u></b></font></h1></li><h1><font color="white"><b> In a typical dark shola forest that is disturbed by a road or in other major opening, this butterfly attracts attention because of its white colour and slow cud fluttering light. In the morning it flies in short bursts, settles close to the ground with its wings closed over the back. The fore wings are drawn between the hind wings so that only the dark and dusted wing portions are visible.
It keeps mainly to low levels but in openings or at the edge of the shola it may wander up small trees where it basks on the leaves. It seeks the flowers of herbs and shrubs and feeds mainly on asteraceae. loquacious and balsaminaceae species, such as various Impatiens, Leucas, Vicoa, and Crepis. The wings are kept closed while it feeds on the flowers. On hot days it can be found at mud- puddling sites. It is most active around noon and in the afternoon.</b></font></h1>
