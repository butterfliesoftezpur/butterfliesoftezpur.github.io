<h1><font color="white"><b>Female- upperside like that of male, upperside brown black, fore wing black from base to veins 2 or 3 and along outer margin, the posteriorly narrowed central area lighter and traversed by black vein and fold- stripes and outer margin undulate with thin white fringe-spots; hind wing with white or red discal patches, a series of submarginal red lunules and a marginalrow of white lunules. Underside of wings reddish brown, fore wing ,darker at base and along the margin, between the veins dark streaks entering the cell; hind wing bearing 2 6 elongate white spots, a large tornal red spot having a black spot, a Fig: Papilio polytes Romulus(Female)series of submarginal reddish lunules and a marginal row ofreddish-white lunules alternating with brown.
Variation:This species is very variable. 
The following three subspecies occur in India.
i)	Papilio polytes romulus Cramer: It is smaller than other two subspecies and is widely distributed in India. Lingga Islands, Malay Peninsula,Myanmar,Natuna Islands, Tong-King.

The female has three forms.
a)	f. romulus Cramer- Fore wing crossed obliquely from middle of cell to tornus by abroad white band, the latter with ill defined edges, beyond apex of cell is diffused white patch. Hind wing with all the discal, submarginal, marginal markings and spot at apex of celI red. It mimics Pachliopta hector (Linnaeus).
b)	f. cyrus Fabricius - Resembles male. Underside hind wing with a series of submarginal ochraceous lunules; in spring these spots are red and larger, and also red on the upperside. 
c)	f. stichius Huebner-Upperside fore wing fuliginous black, darker at base and along outer margin leaving a pale greyish trinaglar area, black streaks between veins entering the cell. Its male has following three known aberrants. 
d)	Ab. sakontala Hewitson- Upperside dull brownish; fore wing without white marginal spots (in male-D' Abrera, 1982),ill defined streaks in cell and between veins being sparingly dusted with yellowish scales; hind wing with diffused greenish white discal spots 'n areas 1-7 and an ill defined tornal red lunule. Underside fore wing with more prominent streaks between veins than on upperside; hind wing basal half bIack, discal series of elongate dingy white spots prominent than on upperside. Assam, Nagaland, Sikkim,Uttarakhand (Mussoorie). Bangladesh. 
e)	Ab.walkeri Jans.- Upperside sooty black. Fore wing with four short ochraceous lines in cell, three in areal and two postdiscal ones in each of areas 1-8; hindwing with broad discal band of blue scaling and postdiscal series of ochraceous-white quadrate spots. Southern India. 
f)	Ab. astreaus Jordan -Upperside fore wing with much larger marginal white spots entering area 8; hind wing with a discal series of black spots darker than ground colour. Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris).
ii)	Papilio polytes nikobarus Felder-Male is larg,er than romulus, Upperside       of hind wing with a narrower discal band. Nicobar Islands. 
Female f. cyrus- Upperside hind wing having slightly developed submarginal lunules and band narrow as in male.
Female f. stichius- Resembles to mainland specimens.
iii)	Papilio polytes stichioides Evans- It is larger than romulus. Upperside of hind  wing without submarginal lunules but discal band broader.(Andaman Islands). 
Female f. cyrus- Upperside hind wing band broader than in the male. Female f. stichius- Larger than mainland specimens, and hind wing with very large and white discal area of five patches.</b></font></h1>

It seldom rises far from the ground. It prefers the shelter of bushes, thick places in the Jungle and hedges. It does not come to wet places but fond of visiting flowers. The flight of male is fast and that of female is slow resembling flight of Pachliopta models.

It is pale orange, opaque, shiny and smudged with pale brown. The larva is about 40 mm in length and 8mm in breadth at the middle. Its head is yellow, crests on segments 4 and 5 yellow and ocellus black. Dorsally, it is rich glaucous green but slightly yellowish on the sides. It is not subject to the attacks of ichneumons. The pupa is olive-brown, with brown, "green, and yellow spots and stripes. The underside its abdomen is milk-white, or the whole pupa is green. The pupal stage occasionally remains for a long time.</b></font></h1>
